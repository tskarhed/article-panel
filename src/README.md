# Article panel

This is a datasource driven version of the default News panel in Grafana core. It works really well in combination with [RSS Data Source](https://github.com/VolkovLabs/volkovlabs-rss-datasource/), where you previously had to use the Dynamic Text panel, which didn't necessarily look similar to the default News panel.
